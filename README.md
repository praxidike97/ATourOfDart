## Important concepts

- Everything is an object, even numbers and functions
- Dart is strongly typed but type annotations are optional (e.g. initialize a number with 'var') as Dart can infer types
- Null safety: variables cannot contain ```null``` unless explicitly said they can. A variable can be made nullable by putting a ? at the end of the type. For example, ```int?``` might be an integer or ```null``` (like an optional type in other languages). Similarly, ! can be used to force an unwrap of a ? type
- Dart has generic types like List<int>, List<Object>
- No public, private, protected attributes. Instead, _ marks it as private
